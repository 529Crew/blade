# Blade

A [pump.fun](https://pump.fun/) bot with integrated monitoring systems built purposefully stateless to allow multiple instances with the same setup to be run and not interfere with each other.

Blade is designed for sniping pump.fun bonding curves at their initial creation based off user defined filters. Its aim is to land within some of the first txs ( following any bundled dev buy ) to get the best price possible and make gains off later buyers.
